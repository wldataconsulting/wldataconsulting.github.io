description: Our winning project demonstrates how to use Apache Spark, a cluster computing framework for commodity hardware, to build applications with Twitter streams and track key dimensions and measures important to business like feeling (measured as sentiment) of customers towards a brand or product over time and locale. This is important because it can help businesses forecast demand for new products or zone in on what customers are saying about their brand on social media in real-time.
