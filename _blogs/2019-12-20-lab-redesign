**Every lab is a set of practices, traditions, recurring events, and expectations.**
These practices determine the daily rhythms of its members.
They affect personal growth, research quality, the relationships between its members,
and how enjoyable it is to be a scientist.
Unfortunately, for reasons relating to complacency and authority, I've found that a lot of labs
just organize themselves in standard ways and don't regularly switch things up.
